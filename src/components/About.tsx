              I am a passionate professional with a deep interest in technology and innovation.

              and grow.

            My name is Priyanka Nath, born in 2004 in Lala, Assam, India. I began my educational journey at Primrose English Medium School, where I studied from KG 1 to Class 10. I then pursued my higher secondary education in the science stream at Ramanuj Gupta Senior Secondary School. Currently, I am pursuing a BSc in Biotechnology from Assam down town University.

Beyond academics, I have a passion for painting, which allows me to express my creativity. I also have a deep love for pets and animals, finding joy in their companionship. My personality leans toward being a little extrovertedâ€”I enjoy talking and connecting with others.

I am equally passionate about technology and coding. With a curiosity-driven mindset, I explored computer science concepts and taught myself to become a front-end and back-end developer. Through self-learning from online resources, I developed a strong foundation in coding, which I continue to build upon.

Always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges, I strive to grow both academically and professionally.
